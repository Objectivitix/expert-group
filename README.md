A classic musical experience with a twist.

To run this app with full features, first start up the server:

```bash
python3 src/app.py
```

Then, simply view `src` in your browser, which should take care of the rest.

Server dependencies:

- flask
- flask_cors
- librosa
- sqlite3

(Use `pip`, the Python package manager, to install them.)
